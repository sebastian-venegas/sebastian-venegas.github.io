Welcome to my **personal notes repository**, where I collect, organize, and reflect on my ongoing studies in mathematics and philosophy.  
These notes serve as a living record of my learning process, research explorations, and conceptual developments.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These notes are my personal interpretations and summaries. They are not formal publications.
