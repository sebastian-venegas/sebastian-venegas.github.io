## Warning 

This is my personal manifesto, a reflection of my thoughts, beliefs, and values. It may challenge conventional views and represents only my own perspective. 

## Introduction 

My guides in life, outside my personal circle, are two figures whose work and teachings profoundly shape my worldview: the great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, whose abstract vision of mathematics inspires my intellectual pursuits, and Jesus of Nazareth, whose ethical and spiritual example guides my moral compass.  

## My Mathematician 

Alexander Grothendieck represents the power of abstraction, depth, and creativity in thinking. His approach to mathematics—seeking structures, relationships, and universality—resonates with my own love for category theory, homology, and algebraic structures. I aspire not only to solve problems but to **understand the underlying essence** of mathematical objects, their connections, and the hidden patterns that govern them.  

In my studies at the University of Costa Rica, I pursue pure mathematics with the guidance of Dr. Jesús Sánchez Guevara, the only professor formally teaching category theory in the country. My work bridges abstract thought and rigorous formalism, exploring topics from tensor products and Grothendieck topologies to original constructions like the "Void" functor, all inspired by Grothendieck’s relentless quest for understanding.  

## My Philosophy


## My Spiritual

Spiritually, I seek a connection to an **initiator or origin** beyond personal deities, following a path that blends reflection, ethics, and transcendence rather than organized religion. I resonate with the ethical teachings of Jesus, emphasizing compassion, integrity, and striving for a just society.  

I consider myself an **anarco-Christian**, integrating the moral principles of Christ with a desire for autonomy, freedom, and social justice. My spirituality is a guide, not a doctrine—an ethical compass rather than a religious institution.  

## My Politics 

I am politically engaged, motivated by the desire to improve society and challenge unjust structures. I align with **progressive and egalitarian principles**, advocating for freedom, education, and rational social policies.  

I recognize the tension between theoretical knowledge and practical perception: many people who have not studied politics may misinterpret my actions as radical or idle, but my aim is **constructive change**, grounded in reflection, ethics, and evidence-based reasoning.  

## Myself

I am passionate about abstraction, logic, and exploring the fundamental structures of mathematics and society. Beyond my academic and intellectual pursuits, I embrace a deep understanding of myself, including my identity, personality, and values.  

I identify as male *he/him) and my sexual orientation is **Pansexuality or Gynosexuality**. I value authenticity, curiosity, and freedom in all aspects of life. I am ambidextrous, highly reflective, and often immerse myself in abstract thinking, yet I strive to maintain balance with social and practical experiences.  

My personality combines a love for rigorous reasoning with empathy and a drive for ethical action. I tend to approach life analytically, enjoy challenges that require creative problem-solving, and seek to connect ideas across disciplines—from mathematics to philosophy to social thought.  

I embrace introspection and self-improvement, constantly questioning my beliefs and actions, striving to live a coherent life aligned with my intellectual, spiritual, and political principles. This integration of personal insight and external engagement defines who I am and guides my ongoing journey of learning and contribution.
