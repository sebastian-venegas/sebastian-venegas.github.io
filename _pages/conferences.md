## Invited Talks & Seminars

### Introduction to Category Theory and Its Applications  
**Science Week, University of Costa Rica**  
*September 2025, San José, Costa Rica*  

This presentation introduced the fundamental concepts of category theory to a general academic audience, emphasizing its role as a unifying language in modern mathematics and its applications across multiple disciplines. The talk covered:

- Basic categorical notions: objects, morphisms, functors, and natural transformations
- Diagrammatic reasoning and universal properties
- Applications in:
  - Mathematics (algebraic topology, homological algebra)
  - Computer science (functional programming, type theory)
  - Physics (topological quantum field theories, symmetry)
  - Philosophy (foundations, logic, structuralism)

The presentation was designed to be accessible to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds, requiring no prior knowledge of category theory.

##  Workshops Attended

### Workshop on Character Varieties and Higgs Bundles  
**Aug 4–8, 2025 — Universidad de Costa Rica, Liberia, Guanacaste**

I attended this **international workshop as an observer**, held under the collaborative framework of the **DFG-CONARE Costa Rican-German Research Project** on Character Varieties and Higgs Bundles. The event brought together young researchers and senior experts to foster research in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and gauge theory.

#### The workshop featured:
- Three intensive mini-courses focused on modern geometric structures.  
- High-level research talks by international mathematicians.  
- Interactive poster sessions for networking and discussion of open problems.  

**Organizers:** Prof. Ronald A. Zúñiga-Rojas, Prof. Alexander H.W. Schmitt  
**Lecturers:** Ana Casimiro, Alfonso Zamora, Guillermo Gallego  

This workshop enriched my understanding of geometric structures linked to **representation theory**, **Higgs bundles**, and their interactions with **topology and physics**, complementing my ongoing research in higher category theory.
