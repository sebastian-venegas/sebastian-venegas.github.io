I am Sebastian Venegas, a passionate category theorist and second-semester student of pure mathematics at the University of Costa Rica. I focus my studies and research interests on higher category theory, homotopy type theory, the philosophical foundations of mathematics and the Politic Philosophy My work strives to bridge the abstract rigor of mathematics with its conceptual and foundational implications.

## Academic Activities and Research

- Currently co-authoring the first comprehensive introductory book on Category Theory in Costa Rica, blending algebraic and homological perspectives under the guidance of Dr. Jesús Sánchez Guevara.
- Developing original research ideas on cellular automata over finite fields and exploring connections in quantum higher topos theory.
- Preparing to enroll in advanced courses in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra to deepen my theoretical framework.

## Conferences and Workshops

### Workshop on Character Varieties and Higgs Bundles  
*August 4th–8th, 2025 — Universidad de Costa Rica, Recinto Liberia, Guanacaste, Costa Rica*

I attended this international workshop as an observer, which was held under the collaborative framework of the DFG-CONARE Costa Rican-German Research Project on Character Varieties and Higgs Bundles. The event featured three mini-courses aimed at fostering young researchers, multiple high-level research talks by renowned mathematicians, and interactive poster sessions.  

The workshop organizers included Prof. Ronald A. Zúñiga-Rojas and Prof. Alexander H.W. Schmitt. Lecturers such as Ana Casimiro, Alfonso Zamora, and Guillermo Gallego guided participants through cutting-edge open problems, promoting active discussion and mentorship throughout the event.  

This opportunity enriched my understanding of geometric structures linked to representation theory and gauge theory, complementing my ongoing research interests.

## Outreach and Collaboration

I am committed to academic outreach and collaboration within the mathematical community, both locally and internationally. Through workshops, seminars, and writing projects, I aim to contribute to the dissemination and development of category theory and related fields in Costa Rica and Latin America.
