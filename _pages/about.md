I am **Sebastian Venegas**, a undeegraduate student of pure mathematics at the University of Costa Rica, 
specializing in **Category Theory** and its intersections with homological algebra, homotopy type theory, 
and the philosophical foundations of mathematics. My research and academic work focus on bridging the rigor of abstract mathematics with its conceptual,
logical, and philosophical implications. I am also interested in exploring **computational**, **physical** and **philosophical** applications of higher category theory.

How i said before, im into the world of *philosophy* especially interested in applications of higher category theory ($$\infty$$-CATS) in philosophy, 
*meta-logic*, *Proofs Theory*, *$$\lambda$$-Calculi*, *Metaphysics*, *Politics Philosophy $$(\textsf{Anarchism})$$*, *Philosophy of Language* and finally *Philosophy of Mind*

I am an active member of the **Pride community** <img src="https://assets.volvo.com/is/image/VolvoInformationTechnologyAB/Intersex-inclusive-pride-flag-1?qlt=82&wid=1024&ts=1686309900377&dpr=off&fit=constrain" width="4%" alt="Intersex-Inclusive Pride Flag">
, engaging with initiatives that promote visibility, inclusion, and diversity within academic and social contexts.  

Politically, I identify with **Anarcho-Syndicalism/christian-Anrchism/Anarcho-Communism** <img src="https://robertgraham.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/christian-anarcho-syndicalist-flag-1.png" width="4%" alt="Anarcho-Syndicalist Flag">
, a philosophy emphasizing horizontal organization, workers‚Äô self-management, and social cooperation. This perspective informs my ethical framework and my engagement with collaborative academic and community projects.

## Academic Activities and Research

### Current Projects

- **Book on Category Theory (Costa Rica)**  
  Co-authoring the first comprehensive introductory book on Category Theory in Costa Rica, blending algebraic, homological, and categorical perspectives, under the mentorship of [Dr. Jes√∫s S√°nchez Guevara](https://justcategories.wordpress.com/about/). The book includes formal treatments of modules, tensor products, and homological constructions, with a pedagogical emphasis for experts and undergraduates.

## Research Interests

- **Higher Category Theory and Homotopy**: exploring ‚àû-categories, derived functors, its applications and foundations with a _mathematical_ and _philosophical_ view.
- **Cellular Automata over Finite Fields**: studying combinatorial and algebraic dynamics with connections to discrete mathematics.
- **Philosophy of Mathematics via Category Theory**: analyzing foundations, logic, and conceptual frameworks through categorical perspectives.
- **General Philosophy and Mathematics Intersections**: examining the role of abstract structures in reasoning, epistemology, and mathematical philosophy.

- **Collaborations**: Engaging with senior researchers locally and internationally, including Prof. Ronald A. Z√∫√±iga-Rojas and Prof. Alexander H.W. Schmitt, on workshops and research discussions in geometric structures and representation theory.

## Outreach and Academic Engagement

I actively participate in academic outreach and collaboration to advance category theory and pure mathematics in Costa Rica and Latin America. This includes:

- Organizing **study groups, seminars, and workshops** for undergraduate students and early researchers.
- Engaging with interdisciplinary research bridging **mathematics, logic, and philosophy**.
