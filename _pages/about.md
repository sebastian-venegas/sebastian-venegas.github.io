I am a category theorist and student of pure mathematics at the University of Costa Rica, passionate about higher category theory, homotopy type theory, and the philosophical foundations of mathematics.

Currently, I am privileged to study under Dr. Jesús Sánchez Guevara, the leading category theorist in Costa Rica, and to collaborate on the first formal course and book on category theory in the country. My research interests include categorical approaches to quantum theory, cellular automata on finite fields, and the interplay between homological algebra and topos theory.

In August 2025, I attended the international workshop on Character Varieties and Higgs Bundles in Liberia, Costa Rica, engaging with leading researchers from around the world.

I am also deeply interested in philosophical applications of category theory, especially regarding materialist dialectics and the foundations of reality as expressed through categorical structures.
