I am **Sebastian Venegas**, an undergraduate student in **Pure Mathematics** at the University of Costa Rica, specializing in **Category Theory** and its intersections with homological algebra, homotopy type theory, algebraic geometry, and the philosophical foundations of mathematics. My work bridges rigorous abstract mathematics with its deep conceptual and philosophical implications ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

I view mathematics as a **garden of ideas** —an enchanted space where we explore the roots of an infinite tree of knowledge. The **pluralism** of mathematics, evident since Gödel's work, finds in Category Theory perhaps the most powerful unifying framework for our time.

## Education 
- **University of Costa Rica** — Bachelor's in Pure Mathematics  
  _(2025–Present), San José, Costa Rica_ 

## Current Projects 
- **Introductory Category Theory Book**  
  Co-authoring an category theory text, blending algebraic, homological, and categorical perspectives under the mentorship of [Dr. Jesús Sánchez Guevara](https://justcategories.wordpress.com/about/). The book emphasizes pedagogical accessibility while covering advanced topics like module categories, tensor products, and homological algebra ✧

## Research Interests 
- Higher category theory & Derived Algebraic Geometry (in the future)
- Categorical foundations & philosophical structuralism and intuisionism
- Algebraic Geometry (Picard Group and Grupoids)
