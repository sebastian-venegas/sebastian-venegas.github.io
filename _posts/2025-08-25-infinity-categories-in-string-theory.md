## Introduction

String theory postulates that the fundamental constituents of the universe are one-dimensional extended objects (strings) rather than point particles. The mathematical description of these structures requires sophisticated tools from geometry and topology. ∞-categories emerge as the natural framework for describing the symmetries and algebraic structures that appear in string theory.

The action of a bosonic string in a gravitational background is given by:

$$S = -\frac{1}{4\pi\alpha'}\int_\Sigma \sqrt{-h}h^{\alpha\beta}\partial_\alpha X^\mu\partial_\beta X^\nu G_{\mu\nu}(X)d^2\sigma$$

where $\alpha'$ is the string tension, $\Sigma$ is the worldsheet, $h_{\alpha\beta}$ is the intrinsic metric, and $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the space-time metric.

## Fundamentals of ∞-Categories

### Definition of $$(\infty,1)$$-Categories

An $$(\infty,1)$$-category $\mathcal{C}$ can be defined as an ∞-categorical functor:

$$\mathcal{C}: \Delta^{op} \to \mathrm{Space}$$

satisfying Segal conditions, where $\Delta$ is the simplex category and $\mathrm{Space}$ is the ∞-category of spaces.

> We use the Segal Space type of $$\infty$$-Category but the Quasi-Categories of Joyal-Lurie are more often used in other branchs, but Segal Spaces gives an easly translation of physical phenomenoms.

### Universal Property

For any pair of objects $$X, Y \in \mathcal{C}$$, the mapping space $$\mathrm{Map}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$$ is a topological space (or a simplicial set) that captures homotopy equivalences between morphisms.

### Example: Conformal Field Theory Category

The category $$\mathbf{CFT}_d$$ of conformal field theories in dimension $d$ forms an $$(\infty,1)$$-category where:
- Objects: Conformal field theories
- 1-morphisms: Deformation functionals
- 2-morphisms: Natural transformations
- ⋮
- ∞-morphisms: Homotopy equivalences

## Moduli Spaces in String Theory

### Superstring Moduli Space

The moduli space $$\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$$ of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures has dimension:

$$\dim_\mathbb{C} \mathcal{M}_{g,n} = 3g - 3 + n$$

For string theory, we must consider the superconformal moduli space $$\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^{\mathrm{super}}$$ whose compactification requires $$\infty$$-categorical algebraic geometry techniques.

### ∞-Categorical Deformation Theory

Deformations of string theories are controlled by ∞-Lie algebras:

$$\mathrm{Def}(S) \simeq MC(\mathfrak{g}_{S})$$

where $$MC(\mathfrak{g}_{S})$$ is the set of solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equation for the $$\infty$$-Lie algebra $$\mathfrak{g}_{S}$$ associated with theory $S$.

## $$A_{\infty}$$ Algebras and Structures in String Theory

### A∞ Algebra in String Amplitudes

The algebraic structure of scattering amplitudes in string theory is governed by an A∞ algebra. For a set of states $\{\Psi_i\}$, the amplitudes satisfy:

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{i_1<\cdots<i_n} m_n(\Psi_{i_1}, \ldots, \Psi_{i_n}) = 0$$

where $m_n$ are multilinear operators satisfying the A∞ relations:

$$\sum_{m=1}^n \sum_{k=0}^{n-m} (-1)^\varepsilon m_{n-m+1}(\Psi_1, \ldots, \Psi_k, m_m(\Psi_{k+1}, \ldots, \Psi_{k+m}), \ldots, \Psi_n) = 0$$

### String Theory Action as A∞ Functor

The effective string theory action defines an A∞ functor:

$$S_{\mathrm{eff}}: \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{string}} \to \mathrm{Ch}_\mathbb{C}$$

where $$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{string}}$$ is the ∞-category of string states and $$\mathbf{Ch}_\mathbb{C}$$ is the category of chain complexes over $\mathbb{C}$.

## Conformal Field Theory Categories

### Segal's Theorem

Segal proved that a conformal field theory (CFT) in dimension 2 defines a functor:

$$Z: \mathrm{Cob}(2) \to \mathrm{Hilb}$$

where $\mathrm{Cob}(2)$ is the category of 2-dimensional cobordisms and $\mathrm{Hilb}$ is the category of Hilbert spaces.

### ∞-Categorical Generalization

In ∞-categorical language, an extended CFT is a functor:

$$Z: \mathrm{Bord}_n^{\mathrm{conf}} \to \mathcal{C}$$

where $\mathrm{Bord}_n^{\mathrm{conf}}$ is the (∞,n)-category of conformal cobordisms and $\mathcal{C}$ is an (∞,n)-algebraic category.

## Applications in Topological String Theory

### Type A Topological String Theory

Type A topological string theory is related to Gromov-Witten cohomology. The genus $g$ potential is given by:

$$F_g = \sum_{\beta \in H_2(X,\mathbb{Z})} N_{g,\beta} e^{-\beta \cdot t}$$

where $N_{g,\beta}$ are the Gromov-Witten invariants.

### ∞-Categorical Structure in Gromov-Witten Invariants

Gromov-Witten invariants can be organized into a functor:

$$GW: \mathcal{M}_{g,n} \to H^*(X^{\otimes n})$$

that lifts to a morphism in the ∞-category of moduli spaces.

## Connections with M-Theory and Dualities

### T-Duality and Fourier-Mukai Categories

T-duality in string theory corresponds to the Fourier-Mukai transform in the derived category of coherent sheaves:

$$\mathrm{FM}_\mathcal{P}: D^b(X) \to D^b(\hat{X})$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ is the Poincaré bundle over $X \times \hat{X}$.

### M-Theory and 5-Categories

M-theory suggests the existence of 5-categorical structures related to compactification on 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds. The effective action includes terms:

$$S_{\mathrm{M}} = \int_{M_{11}} \left[ \sqrt{-g}R - \frac{1}{2}G_4 \wedge \star G_4 - \frac{1}{6}C_3 \wedge G_4 \wedge G_4 \right] + \cdots$$

## Conclusions and Future Perspectives

∞-categories provide the appropriate mathematical framework for describing the deep structures of string theory. Future directions include:

1. **Development of an ∞-categorical theory of quantum gravity**
2. **Connections with the geometric Langlands program**
3. **Applications to holography and AdS/CFT correspondence**
4. **Generalization to conformal field theories in higher dimensions**

The integration of ∞-categorical methods promises to solve fundamental problems in string theory and quantum gravity.
